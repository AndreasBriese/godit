A very religious text editor. In design and early development stage.

So, why do I call it religious, because it's very religious about many
customizations you usually see in other text editors. There is a strong believe
of the "one true way". But keep in mind that I'm not trying to enforce anyone
into this, it's my way and editor is basically written for myself. Incomplete
list would be:

 - '\n' is the only way to end the line
 - '\t' has width of 8 symbols
 - indentation is always about tab characters
 - syntax highlighting is a useless feature
 - all text files are utf-8


I've recently added buffer saving feature, so it is kind of usable now, but use
at your own risk. I strongly suggest you to do that only on files under version
control systems.
